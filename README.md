# Steamworks-Robot
Team 5830's robot code for FIRST Steamworks (2017). Our robot's name was Classy Chassis.

## Our Robot's Features

#### Gear Delivery
We used a passive gear delivery system consisting of two acrylic sheets with a 2-inch gap in the center. This allowed the gears to be delivered to the robot, and for the pilots to pick them up by having the robot drive into the peg.

#### Climbing
We utilized two bag motors attached to one gearbox to provide the strength required to climb using hook-and-loop tape.

#### 6 CIM, 8 Wheel Tank Drive
With this amount of power, we were able to shove other robots away. This, combined with good driving, made us a very good defense bot.
